2. Overview of project idea. This should be approximately half a page long.
3. A short literature survey of 4 or more relevant papers. The literature review should
   take up approximately one page.
4. Description of potential data sets to use for the experiments.
5. Plan of activities, and how you plan to divide up the work.

### Project Progress Report

1. Project progress and accomplishments.
2. Preliminary results.
3. Challenges and problems (if any).
4. Changes to the original plan (if any).
5. Remaining work and plan to finish the project.

### Final Report

1. Introduction: problem definition and motivation.
2. Background & Related Work: background info and literature survey.
3. Methods: overview of your proposed method, Intuition on why should it be better than
   the state of the art, and details of models and algorithms that you developed.
4. Results: Description of your experiments and results and a list of questions your
   experiments are designed to answer.
5. Conclusion: discussion and future work.
